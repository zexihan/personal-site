#### Intro
Hi, I am Zexi Han, a perception software engineer working in Shanghai.
<br><br>
I can speak English, Mandarin and Japanese (still learningâ€¦). I love traveling and enjoy communicating with local people. Dream of being a voyager and travelling around the world!
<br><br>
In terms of specialization, my latest work develops the state-of-the-art LiDAR point cloud 3D detection, tracking, and segmentation algorithms in autonomous driving. Making efforts to gain an insight into various 3D deep learning algorithms, I have a keen interest in applying them to make the world a better place. Besides, I am also interested in building web or mobile applications employing various tech stacks, which is full of fun!
