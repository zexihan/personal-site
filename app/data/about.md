#### Intro
Hi, I am Zexi Han, a computer vision software engineer working in Silicon Valley.
<br><br>
I can speak English, Mandarin and Japanese (still learningâ€¦). I love traveling and enjoy communicating with local people. Dream of being a voyager and travelling around the world! And here is my Instagram to follow!
<br><br>
In terms of specialization, my latest work develops state-of-the-art visual recognition algorithms for cashier-less convenience stores with 3D deep learning on point cloud. Making efforts to gain an insight into various deep learning algorithms, I have a keen interest in applying them to make the world a better place. I am also interested in building web or mobile applications employing various tech stacks, which is full of fun!
